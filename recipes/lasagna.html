        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This lasagna is great for a quick meal for one!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1.5 cups water</li>
            <li>0.25 cup marinara sauce</li>
            <li>0.25 chopped cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>0.5 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>0.5 cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Break each lasagna noodle into 6 rectangular pieces. Place noodles in a 4-cup 
                microwave-safe bowl. Add water, making sure noodles are covered and water level 
                is about halfway up the bowl. Place the bowl on a microwave-safe plate.</li>
            <li>Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir pasta quickly to keep it from 
                clumping. Cook in 2-minute increments, stirring in between, and emptying any 
                water that has boiled over onto the plate. Repeat until lasagna is tender yet 
                firm to the bite, about 6 minutes total. Drain noodles, reserving 1 tablespoon 
                of the cooking liquid. Return noodles and reserved liquid to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir marinara sauce and chopped tomatoes into the bowl, mixing until incorporated. 
                Sprinkle on basil, and then mozzarella cheese. Cover surface of the bowl with a 
                paper towel to prevent splatter and microwave until cheese is completely melted 
                and tomato sauce is warmed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
