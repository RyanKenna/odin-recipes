        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This incredibly easy and quick to prepare traybake tastes like heaven on a plate 
            with its marshmallow, coconutty goodness! I like to use a combination of white 
            and pink marshmallows. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>15 large marshmallows</li>
            <li>15 digestive biscuits, crushed</li>
            <li>15 red candied cherries, halved</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 cup sweetened flaked coconut</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the marshmallows in halves using scissors, and place in a large bowl. 
                Toss with the digestive biscuits and candied cherries. Gradually stir in the 
                sweetened condensed milk until the mixture becomes a soft, moist dough. It 
                should not be too dry, so you may need to add a bit more of the milk.</li>
            <li>Spread a generous layer of coconut out on a clean surface, and place the 
                dough on top of it. Use your hands to form the dough into a long thick 
                sausage, making sure it is well coated with coconut. Wrap in a double layer 
                of plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the long piece of dough, and cut into slices to serve.</li>
        </ol>
